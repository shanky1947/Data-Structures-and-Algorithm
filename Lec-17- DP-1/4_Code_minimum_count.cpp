Code : Minimum Count
Send Feedback
Given an integer N, find and return the count of minimum numbers required to represent N as a sum of squares.
That is, if N is 4, then we can represent it as : {1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} and {2^2}. The output will be 1, as 1 is the minimum count of numbers required to represent N as sum of squares.
Input format :
The first and the only line of input contains an integer value, 'N'.
 Output format :
Print the minimum count of numbers required.
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10 ^ 4

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
12
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
12 can be represented as : 
A) (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1)

B) (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1)  + (2 ^ 2)

C) (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (1^1) + (2 ^ 2) + (2 ^ 2)

D) (2 ^ 2) + (2 ^ 2) + (2 ^ 2)

As we can see, the output should be 3.
Sample Input 2 :
9
Sample Output 2 :
1
